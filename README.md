# ddg-exercises

All the exercises for the DDG Course solved (except for the parameterization one, I ended up skipping that one)

All solutions my own, except the one for geometric flow. I know I copied that one from some other user's fork but I don't remember who to credit them

The Vector Field Decomposition project cannot run on MSVC (some weird bug with Polyscope) but does run from wsl. Tests run on MSVC but segfault on Linux
